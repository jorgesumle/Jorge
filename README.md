## Empty window
Just a base Pygame window. It has an icon and a title, but it's empty.

## Full screen
A game in which you can toggle between normal and full screen mode pressing F11. The hardest part of the game comes when you're in full screen mode. You must exit this mode pressing the Escape button.
