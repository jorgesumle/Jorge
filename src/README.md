# Organization
Python files here are complete games. Some games are inside folders
because they need more than just a python file to run (they may require
music, images...). This is a way to keep things more organized. If you
don't need a game, you can just delete its folder.
# How to run games?
Just execute a game in this directory. If the python file is not in this
directory, because it's inside a folder, go inside its folder and execute
the file called `main.py`.
